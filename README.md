# Eskiel`s Kafka+Springboot sample
This is just a simple sample I am doing to study Kafka behavior

This project contain both Kafka sides (Consumer and Producer)

To run the project you must have a Kafka instance running in your computer.

Even being so simple, this is a functional project and I plan to use it whenever I need to manage a Kafka project.

The more I learn about Kafka, the more I'm going to improve this project... (The same is valid to all other repositories I have and its respective technologies)
